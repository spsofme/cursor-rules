# Clean Code Guidelines

## Constants Over Magic Numbers
- Replace hard-coded values with named constants when modifying or adding code.
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose.

## Meaningful Names
- Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are universally understood.

## Smart Comments
- Do NOT comment on obvious behavior.
- Use comments to explain *why* something is done, not *what* is done.
- Document complex logic and non-obvious side effects.

## Single Responsibility
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility when writing new code.
- Do NOT split existing functions unless explicitly requested.

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Avoid introducing new duplication.
- Extract shared logic ONLY when explicitly requested or clearly necessary.

## Clean Structure
- Keep related code together.
- Follow existing file and folder organization.
- Do NOT reorganize structure unless explicitly instructed.

## Encapsulation
- Hide implementation details behind clear interfaces.
- Avoid exposing internal state unnecessarily.

## Code Quality Maintenance
- Do NOT refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Do NOT introduce "cleanup" changes beyond the scope of the request.
- Focus on correctness over stylistic improvements.

## Testing
- Write or update tests only when explicitly requested.
- When writing tests, keep them readable and focused.
- Cover edge cases relevant to the change.

## Version Control
- Write clear, concise commit messages when requested.
- Keep commits focused on a single logical change.
