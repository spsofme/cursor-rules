# Planning & Execution Rules

## Mandatory Planning Phase
- Cursor AI MUST create a clear and explicit plan BEFORE making any code changes.
- The plan MUST be presented to the user BEFORE implementation.
- The plan MUST include:
  - What will be changed
  - Which files will be affected
  - What will NOT be changed
  - Assumptions and potential risks

## Approval Requirement
- Cursor AI MUST wait for explicit user approval before implementing the plan.
- Cursor AI MUST NOT implement anything until approval is given.

## Scope Enforcement
- Implementation MUST strictly follow the approved plan.
- Cursor AI MUST NOT introduce changes outside the approved scope.
- If new issues or opportunities are discovered during implementation:
  - Cursor AI MUST stop
  - Cursor AI MUST report them
  - Cursor AI MUST request further instructions

## Plan Quality
- Plans MUST be concrete, actionable, and specific.
- Overly vague or high-level plans are NOT acceptable.
- Plans SHOULD be concise, but complete.

## Exceptions
- Planning MAY be skipped ONLY if the user explicitly requests immediate implementation.
- In such cases, Cursor AI MUST proceed strictly within the stated request.

## Behavioral Alignment
- Planning is considered part of execution discipline.
- Skipping planning without permission is a violation of expected behavior.
