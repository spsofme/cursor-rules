# React + TypeScript Rules

## Architecture Selection
- Cursor AI MUST NOT assume or invent a frontend architecture.
- When starting a new project, Cursor AI MUST ask which architectural approach should be used.
- Supported approaches may include (but are not limited to):
  - Feature-based architecture
  - Atomic Design
  - Layered frontend architecture
  - SPA with centralized state
  - Micro-frontend
  - Custom / user-defined structure
- Cursor AI MUST apply ONLY the architecture explicitly chosen by the user.
- Do NOT mix architectural styles unless explicitly instructed.

## Project Initialization
- Cursor AI MAY initialize a React + TypeScript project when explicitly requested.
- Project structure MUST be derived strictly from the selected architecture.
- If required folders or layers are missing, Cursor AI SHOULD create them to complete the structure.
- Cursor AI MUST NOT introduce additional patterns, tools, or abstractions beyond the selected architecture.

## Project Structure
- Create folders and files according to the selected architecture.
- Use clear, conventional naming for components, hooks, and modules.
- Do NOT move or reorganize existing files unless explicitly instructed.

## Components
- Components MUST be focused and single-responsibility.
- Prefer function components.
- Avoid large, monolithic components.
- Do NOT refactor existing components unless explicitly requested.

## Hooks
- Custom hooks MUST encapsulate reusable behavior only.
- Do NOT introduce custom hooks unless explicitly requested.
- Avoid side effects outside of React lifecycle hooks.

## State Management
- Use the state management solution explicitly specified by the user.
- Do NOT introduce new state management libraries unless explicitly requested.
- Keep state as local as possible unless otherwise instructed.
- Avoid unnecessary global state.

## Props & Types
- Props MUST be explicitly typed.
- Avoid using `any`.
- Use interfaces or type aliases consistently.
- Do NOT change existing public component props unless explicitly requested.

## Side Effects & Data Fetching
- Side effects MUST be handled explicitly.
- Use the data-fetching approach specified by the user.
- Do NOT introduce new data-fetching libraries unless explicitly requested.
- Handle loading and error states explicitly when modifying behavior.

## Styling
- Cursor AI MUST NOT assume or enforce any styling solution.
- Styling approach (e.g. Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, styled-components, design system) MUST be explicitly specified by the user.
- If no styling approach is specified, Cursor AI MUST ask before proceeding.
- Do NOT introduce or change styling solutions unless explicitly requested.
- Do NOT modify existing styles unless explicitly instructed.

## Error Handling
- Handle UI errors explicitly.
- Avoid silent failures.
- Do NOT expose internal errors directly to the UI unless requested.

## Performance
- Avoid premature optimization.
- Do NOT introduce memoization, virtualization, or performance optimizations unless explicitly requested.

## Testing
- Cursor AI MAY create frontend tests when explicitly requested.
- Follow existing testing tools and conventions.
- Do NOT add or modify tests unless explicitly instructed.

## Accessibility
- Follow basic accessibility best practices when writing new UI.
- Do NOT introduce accessibility refactors unless explicitly requested.

## Code Style
- Follow existing ESLint / Prettier rules in the project.
- Do NOT reformat code for style-only reasons.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions, patterns, or syntactic cleverness.
