### Organization of rules
- Organize .cursorrules files into clear categories under the `rules` directory.
- Use descriptive folder and file names that reflect the rule content.
- Refer to folder-level README files for naming conventions and descriptions.

### Naming and formatting
- Use descriptive names for .cursorrules files and folders.
- Maintain alphabetical order within categories where applicable.
- Use consistent formatting for list items and headings.

### Content guidelines
- Focus on project-specific instructions and best practices.
- Include comments to explain complex rules when necessary.
- Use clear and concise language.
- Provide context about project structure, architectural decisions, or commonly used patterns.

### Optional README files
- A .cursorrules file may include an accompanying README.md file.
- Use this README to give credit to the original author and describe the rule’s purpose.

### Maintenance and updates
- Update the main README.md when adding or modifying rules.
- Keep links relative and accurate.
- Ensure the table of contents remains correct.
- Review and update categorization as the repository grows.

### Additional notes
- .cursorrules files are repository-level “Rules for AI”.
- These rules are appended to Cursor’s global AI rules.
- Focus on repo-level context, not generic coding advice.
- Rules may cover both code generation and code understanding.
